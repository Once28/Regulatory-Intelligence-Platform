Topical fluorouracil may kill precancerous cells. Imiquimod ointment may stimulate the immune system. Applying topical fluorouracil and imiquimod ointment may cause fewer side effects and may be a better way to treat patients with precancerous cervical lesions.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Assess feasibility, evaluated based on safety and tolerability, of a combination agent intervention (once-weekly self-administered intravaginal application of 5-fluorouracil alternating with once-weekly provider-applied imiquimod) for treatment of high-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess efficacy of the combination agent intervention on cervical disease regression (endpoint based on histologic regression from high-grade lesions to low-grade or no lesions and clearance of high risk-human papillomavirus \\[HPV\\] detection) between baseline and study exit visits.\n\nII. Assess efficacy of the combination agent intervention on genotype-specific HPV clearance between baseline and study exit visits.\n\nIII. Assess efficacy of the combination agent intervention on biomarkers of local immune activation (measurement of changes in expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and T-regulatory cells and the levels of innate, immune mediating and proinflammatory cytokines with intravaginal 5-fluorouracil \\[FU\\] and imiquimod) between baseline and study exit visits.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of imiquimod.\n\nPatients receive topical fluorouracil intravaginally via applicator at weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 and imiquimod intravaginally via applicator at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16.

Donor white blood cells that are treated in the laboratory with anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)3 may help treat metastatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells. Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cells, including natural killer cells, to kill metastatic cancer cells. Giving anti-ESO (cancer/test antigen) mTCR-transduced autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes together with combination chemotherapy and aldesleukin may kill more cancer cells.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI.

Not a lot is known about how FdCyd works in the body. Researchers want to look at a modified form of FdCyd using imaging studies to see how the drug reacts with the cancer. This study is not a treatment study. It is open only to people who are already on the FdCyd and THU cancer treatment study.\n\nObjectives:\n\n\\- To study how FdCyd affects advanced cancer cells.\n\nEligibility:\n\n\\- Participants in National Cancer Institute study 09-C-0214.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will have two imaging studies, one before starting FdCyd and THU treatment and one after starting treatment.\n* Participants will have the modified FdCyd, known as F-18 FdCyd, with a dose of THU. The doses will be followed by two imaging study scans and frequent blood samples.\n* This procedure will be repeated at a later date, during the FdCyd and THU treatment period.\n* Treatment will not be provided as part of this study. This is an imaging study protocol only....","detailedDescription":"BACKGROUND:\n\n\\- In pre-clinical models, 5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine (FdCyd), administered along with\n\ntetrahydrouridine (THU; an inhibitor of cytidine/deoxycytidine deaminase), has shown superior anti-tumor activity as compared with 5-fluorouracil.\n\n\\- FdCyd can be phosphorylated to 5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidylate (FdCMP) by deoxycytidine\n\nkinase and the nucleotide deaminated to FdUMP by deoxycytidylate (dCMP) deaminase.\n\nThe activity of dCMP deaminase is reported to be higher in human malignancies than in normal tissues, which may result in selective cytotoxicity.\n\n* FdCyd is an inhibitor of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase and DNA methylation, resulting in reexpression of genes silenced by DNA hypermethylation. It is being evaluated in a phase II multihistology clinical trial at the Developmental Therapeutics Clinic, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n* While FdCyd + THU has shown preliminary evidence of activity in early phase trials not all patients show clinical response. The establishment of a radiolabeled form to image the biodistribution in vivo at baseline and during therapy may provide insight into the distribution of the therapeutic drug.\n* The first step in the development of such an in vivo marker is to determine the\n\nbiodistribution and safety of the radiolabeled form.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\n* Determine the safety of \\[F-18\\]-5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (FdCyd) administered intravenously with administration of tetrahydrouridine (THU).\n* Estimate the radiation dosimetry of \\[F-18\\]-FdCyd in humans.\n\nELIGIBILITY:\n\n* Only patients enrolled in NCI Phase II Study evaluating FdCyd with THU (NCI Protocol # 09-C-0214 (CTEP# 8351) or NCI Protocol #12-C-0066 (CTEP# 9127)) at the NIH Clinical Center will be eligible to participate in this study).\n* Patients must have a target lesion greater than or equal to 10mm\n* May not be pregnant or lactating; must be less than or equal to 350 lbs; and may not have known allergy to FdCyd or contraindications to positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging.\n\nDESIGN:\n\n* There are two arms to this study\n* The first arm will be patients enrolling in the therapeutic Phase II 5-FdCyd/THU study (NCI Protocol # 09-C-0214 (CTEP# 8351) in the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Clinic\n* The second arm will be patients enrolling in the Phase I 5-FdCyd/THU study (NCI Protocol #12-C-0066 (CTEP# 9127)) in the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Clinic.\n* Patients will undergo an initial \\[F-18\\]-FdCyd + THU PET/CT imaging prior to therapeutic dosing on study NCI Protocol # 09-C-0214 (CTEP# 8351) or NCI Protocol #12-C-0066 (CTEP# 9127). Repeat imaging will be performed while the patient is receiving FdCyd + THU therapy under the parent therapeutic protocol. This imaging must be completed 2-5 days after cycle start and at least 2 hours after a dose.

A new therapy has been developed that involves taking white blood cells from a person, genetically modifying the cells in a lab so they recognize cancer, and then giving the cells back to the person. Researchers want to see if this therapy can help people with cervical cancer.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo find out if people with Stage IIB-IVA cervical cancer can safely be given E7 T-cell receptor (TCR) T cells before they get standard treatment.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople age 18 and older who have Stage IIB-IVA cervical cancer\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened under a separate protocol. Tests will include:\n\n* Physical exam\n* Medicine review\n* Blood tests\n* Pregnancy test (if needed)\n* Vein assessment\n* Tumor sample or biopsy\n* Electrocardiogram (to record the hearts electrical activity)\n* Imaging scans, x-rays, and/or endoscopy\n* Heart and/or lung tests.\n\nSome screening tests will be repeated during the study.\n\nParticipants will undergo leukapheresis. For this, blood is removed through a needle in the arm. A machine removes the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm. Participants may need to have a large catheter inserted into a vein.\n\nParticipants will stay at the hospital for 2-3 weeks. They will get chemotherapy drugs. They will get the E7 TCR T cells as an intravenous infusion. They will get the drug aldesleukin.\n\nParticipants will visit the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3 and 6 weeks after treatment. They will be contacted yearly for 5 years. They will be asked to participate in long-term follow-up for 15 years....","detailedDescription":"Background:\n\n* Cervical cancer is the third most common cause of death among women with gynecologic cancers in the United States. Worldwide, cervical cancer accounts for nearly 300,000 deaths annually.\n* Virtually all cases of cervical cancer result from chronic infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common type being HPV16.\n* The treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer consists of chemoradiation +/- extended field radiation therapy. Participants with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) (revised 2018) stage III-IVA have the worse prognosis with approximately 50% of the participants dying from their disease within 5 years.\n* Induction chemotherapy is an active area of study in this type of cancer. The aim of induction therapy is to reduce the risk of disease recurrence and improve overall survival.\n* E7 T-cell receptor (TCR) T cells, administered as a single infusion, have demonstrated safety and clinical activity in advanced, treatment-refractory metastatic HPV+ cancers.\n\nObjectives:\n\n-To determine the feasibility of induction E7 TCR T cell therapy for FIGO (2018) stage IIB-IVA, HPV16+ cervical cancer\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Participants greater than or equal to 18 years old with FIGO (2018) stage IIB-IVA cervical cancer.\n* The cancer must be human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16+) and participant must be HLA-A\\*02:01+.\n* Participants must be treatment-naive (i.e., no prior local or systemic treatment, including radiation; prior loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) procedure or cone biopsy is allowed).\n\nDesign:\n\n* This is a single arm, pilot study, testing the feasibility of induction E7 TCR T cell therapy.\n* Participants will receive a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, a single infusion of E7 TCR T cells, and systemic aldesleukin.\n* Participants will be referred for standard of care definitive therapy (i.e., chemoradiation +/- extended field radiation therapy) within 6 weeks after infusion of E7 TCR T cells."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"],"keywords":["T Cell Receptor","Immunotherapy","Aldesleukin","Cyclophosphamide","Fludarabine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1/E7 T-Cell Receptor (TCR) T Cell Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"E7 TCR T Cell Therapy","interventionNames":["Biological: E7 T-Cell Receptor (TCR)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"E7 T-Cell Receptor (TCR)","description":"Patients will receive up to 3x10\\^10 E7 T-Cell Receptor (TCR) T cells (i.e. TCR+ cells).","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1/E7 T-Cell Receptor (TCR) T Cell Therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Fraction of Participants for Whom E7 T-Cell Receptor (TCR) Induction Therapy is Feasible in Participants With Cervical Cancer","description":"The Fraction of participants for whom E7 T-Cell Receptor (TCR) induction therapy is feasible in participants with cervical cancer","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fraction of Participants With Relapse-free Survival at 2 Years and 5 Years Following Definitive Standard of Care Therapy","description":"Fraction of participants with relapse-free survival at 2 years and 5 years estimated from a Kaplan-Meier curve of relapsed free survival following definitive standard of care therapy who achieve a success.

Human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16+) tumor and HLA-A\\*02:01+ Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type. Note: HLA-A\\*02 is also acceptable for enrollment but not for treatment.\n3. Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria or Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) (if not eligible by RECIST 1.1).\n4. Age 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of E7 TCR T cells in participants \\<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study. Note: This age range is consistent with the age of participants with the disease being studied.\n5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.\n6. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because E7 TCR T cells have unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Women of child- bearing potential are defined as all women who are not post-menopausal or who have not had a hysterectomy. Note: Postmenopausal will be defined in this study as women over the age of 55 who have not had a menstrual period in at least 1 year.\n7. The effects of E7 TCR T cells on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because the chemotherapy agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (e.g., intrauterine device, hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence; tubal ligation or vasectomy) prior to study entry and for four months after treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n8. Seronegative for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) antibody. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Participants who are HIV seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental treatment.\n9. Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen and hepatitis C antibody. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then the participant must be tested for the presence of antigen by Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and be hepatitis C Virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) negative.\n10. Must be willing to participate in Gene Therapy Long Term Follow up Protocol (20C0051), which will follow participants for up to 15 years per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements.\n11.

History of severe allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to agents used in study.\n4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations at the time of treatment that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n5. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with E7 TCR T cells, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with E7 TCR T cells. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n6. Participants with any form of systemic immunodeficiency, including acquired deficiency such as HIV or primary immunodeficiency such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease, are ineligible. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Participants who have decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the treatment.\n7. Participants on immunosuppressive drugs including corticosteroids.\n8. Participants with autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune pancreatitis, or systemic lupus erythematosus.

PSMA is also expressed in angiogenesis but otherwise has limited expression in normal tissue.\n* N-\\[N-\\[(S)-1,3-dicarboxypropyl\\]carbamoyl\\]-4-(18)F-fluorobenzyl-L-cysteine ((18)F-DCFBC) (18F-DCFBC) is a radiolabeled positron emission tomography (PET) agent which binds with high affinity to PSMA and through whole-body non-invasive functional imaging, may provide new information on the expression of PSMA.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\n\\- To assess the ability of 18F-DCFBC to differentiate between tumorous and nontumorous tissues in localized, recurrent (based on rising prostatic-specific antigen ((PSA) post treatment) and metastatic prostate cancer\n\nEligibility\n\n* Subject is greater than or equal to 18 years old\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-2 with adenocarcinoma of the prostate and fits criteria for one of the following:\n* ARM 1\n\n  \\-- Patients with known localized prostate cancer with a soft tissue lesion at least 6mm or greater.\n\n  ---A multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (standard of care at the National Institutes of Health ((NIH) Clinical Center) must be performed within 4 months of18F-DCFBC injection with findings suggestive for prostate cancer and confirmed with histopathology.\n* ARM 2\n\n  * Patients with biochemical prostate cancer relapse after definitive treatment\n\n    * For patients status post radiation therapy for prostate cancer, a PSA increase from post radiation therapy nadir\n    * OR\n    * For patients status post prostatectomy, any PSA \\>/=0.2 ng/ml\n  * Nonspecific or no evidence for disease on standard imaging modality\n* ARM 3\n\n  * Patients with identifiable metastatic disease on a conventional imaging modality.

Patients with presumed localized disease will undergo a standard of care, clinical multiparametric endorectal coil MRI in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Molecular Imaging Clinic within 4 months of screening. Patients in Arm 3 will undergo 2 imaging sessions: baseline and 4-6 month follow-up. Clinical records (including PSA) and treatment (if any) that occurred in the imaging interval must be available. All patients in Arm 3 will also undergo Na18F PET/CT for evaluation of bone metastases as part of this protocol. In order to allow for a small number of nonevaluable patients, the accrual ceiling will be set at 125."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Prostatic Neoplasms","Prostate Cancer"],"keywords":["Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen","Radiolabeled PET Agent","Imaging","NaF"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":116,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Suspected Localized Prostate Cancer","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with known localized prostate cancer with a soft tissue lesion at least 6mm or greater.","interventionNames":["Drug: 18F DCFBC"]},{"label":"Biochemical Recurrence","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with biochemical prostate cancer relapse after definitive treatment","interventionNames":["Drug: 18F DCFBC"]},{"label":"Known Metastatic Disease","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with identifiable metastatic disease on a conventional imaging modality.

To determine the toxicity associated with the administration of irradiated haploidentical cells (IHC) to patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine if there is evidence of disease response associated with IHC.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine if treatment with the irradiated cells induces an immune response targeting tumor associated epitopes.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT I: Within 42 days after hematopoietic engraftment (both neutrophils and platelets) after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), patients receive initial treatment with IHC. Patients that do not have evidence of relapse or progressive disease may be treated every 8-12 weeks for up to 3 doses.\n\nCOHORT II: Patients with high-risk disease receive initial treatment with IHC within 70 days after hematopoietic engraftment (both neutrophils and platelets) after allogeneic HSCT. Patients being treated for relapsed disease may receive initial treatment with IHC any time after relapse is documented. Patients that do not have evidence of relapse or progressive disease may be treated every 8-12 weeks for up to 3 doses.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients will be followed up within 8 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia","Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission","Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Recipient","JAK2 Gene Mutation","Loss of Chromosome 17p","Mantle Cell Lymphoma","Minimal Residual Disease","Myelodysplastic Syndrome","Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma","Plasma Cell Myeloma","RAS Family Gene Mutation","Recurrent Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma","Recurrent Hematologic Malignancy","Recurrent Mature T- and NK-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma","Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma","Refractory Mature T-Cell and NK-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma","Therapy-Related Acute Myeloid Leukemia","Therapy-Related Myelodysplastic Syndrome","TP53 Gene Mutation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort I (initial IHC within 42 days)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Within 42 days after hematopoietic engraftment (both neutrophils and platelets) after autologous HSCT, patients receive initial treatment with IHC.

Aldara is a drug that activates toll-like receptor (TLR) in oral cancer cells causing self-destruction of tumor cells. It also activates immune cells to attack and eliminate cancer cells. Aldara is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of skin cancer and melanoma. Its use in this study is 'off-label' (use of a drug approved by FDA for skin cancer to treat oral cancer in this study).\n\nThe preliminary efficacy of topical imiquimod in a neoadjuvant setting in patients with early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma will be determined by a reduction in tumor cellularity in post-treatment tissue compared to pre-treatment tissue. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by CTCAE v5 criteria. The effect of imiquimod on the tumor immune microenvironment will be assessed by performing quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence.","detailedDescription":"The researchers propose an exploratory clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of topical imiquimod, a TLR-7 agonist, in patients with early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma. The analysis of pre- and post-treatment tumor specimen collected from patients treated on this study will be used for quantitative immunoflourescence analysis to assess the immunomodulatory activity of imiquimod in human tumor samples. The researchers hypothesize that TLR-7 stimulation will reduce the size of the tumor in patients with early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma. The researchers anticipate that activation of immune cells will correlate with response to therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental: Topical Aldara","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All patients receive the same treatment (there is no \"placebo\" arm).

Recently, two new drugs that seem to work together have been shown to have promising treatment effects in tissue culture and animal models of glioblastoma. Each inhibits a different glioblastoma growth pathway and when used together may create a larger effect on tumor growth than either alone. Growth pathway describes a series of chemical reactions in which a group of molecules in a cell work together to control cell growth. It is known that glioblastoma tumor cells can grow because of lack of regulation. Both Pyk2 and the closely related kinase (FAK) proteins help regulate tumor cell invasion, unless they are produced in large amounts (over expressed). Specifically, Raf and FAK/Pyk2 regulation of cell division is activated quite a bit more in gliomas compared to normal tissues. Recently developed inhibitors of Raf (VS-6766) and FAK (defactinib) which belong to a class of medications called kinase inhibitors, are aimed to bring their activity to proper levels and may stop tumor growth.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI.

The SNA consists of nucleic acids arranged on the surface of a small spherical gold nanoparticle. This is a first-in-human trial to determine the safety of NU-0129. NU-0129 can cross the blood brain barrier (a filtering mechanism that carry blood to the brain). Once within the tumor, the nucleic acid component is able to target a gene called Bcl2L12 that is present in glioblastoma multiforme, and is associated with tumor growth. This gene prevents tumor cells from apoptosis, which is the process of programmed cell death, thus promoting tumor growth. Researchers think that targeting the Bcl2L12 gene with NU-0129 will help stop cancer cells from growing.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI.

Posaconazole is a drug which doctors already use for fungal infections and is thought to be able to effect tumor cells. As treatments for this type of brain tumor are limited, it is hoped that the results of this study will help to determine if the study drug should be studied further as a possible treatment.","detailedDescription":"Both ketoconazole and posaconazole are FDA-approved anti-fungal agents with a well-established side effect and safety profile. Ketoconazole and posaconazole have shown efficacy in reducing tumor cell proliferation in in-vitro studies. Furthermore, both have also shown efficacy, mediated at least in part through inhibition of HK2 activity, in animal models with dosing concentration and schedules that are documented as safe in humans. As a drug, posaconazole has a more predictable half-life than ketoconazole and has less off-target effects. Therefore, the proposed trial will focus on the role of posaconazole exclusively. As a first step, demonstration of adequate penetrance of study drug in brain and tumor tissue (pharmacokinetics) and biological effect (inhibition of glycolysis and subsequent tumor cell death) is necessary prior to large scale clinical studies. A total of 5 control participants will be included in this study as the investigator specifically wants to assess for pharmacodynamic differences too. The addition of a control group to this study rather to both the studies (ketoconazole study is a separate protocol) is because the investigator feels posaconazole may be a more promising drug for moving forward.\n\nPlasma drug concentration measurements are an unreliable method to assess delivery of drugs across the blood-brain barrier. In contrast, intracerebral MDC monitoring allows for approximate measurements within extracellular fluid (ECF) sampling of the brain. MDC placement within the brain is not a novel technique and has been utilized routinely in the ICU setting to measure brain metabolism by sampling of ECF of traumatic brain injury patients \\[59-61\\].\n\nMDC are now FDA-approved and are being placed routinely with intracranial pressure monitors. This method allows for continuous measurement of ECF within a tumor or normal tissue. The dialysis probe has a semipermeable membrane which is less than 1 mm in diameter into which two sections of microcatheter are fused. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of keeping the catheters in place of critically injured patients for up to 2 weeks \\[62-64\\].\n\nWhen placed at the time of surgical resection, the microcatheters are stereotactically implanted, placing the probe within the desired brain and/or tumor region. Externally, the catheter is connected to a syringe pump, which delivers a low flow rate (μl/min) of continuous perfusion fluid (Lactated Ringers or artificial CSF) and dialysate is collected in a microvial from the outlet tube. This sterile, single use catheter is minimally invasive and developed to achieve optimal diffusing characteristics similar to passive diffusion of a capillary blood vessel. Just as in the function of brain capillary vessel, water, inorganic ions and small organic molecules freely diffuse across the membrane of the probe, whereas proteins and protein bound compounds are impermeable. Additionally, lipophilic compounds are poorly recovered. Therefore, assessment of pharmacokinetics of drug using MDC provides valuable insight relevant to its anti-neoplastic properties."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Glioblastoma","Glioblastoma Multiforme","Glioblastoma Multiforme of Brain","Glioblastoma Multiforme, Adult"],"keywords":["Glioblastoma","Glioblastoma Multiforme","GBM","Brain cancer","Posaconazole","Anti-fungal agents"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Posaconazole","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be taking 300 mg of the study drug (three 100 mg tablets) by mouth twice a day the first day and then 300 mg once a day until the day of biopsy or surgery.

To compare the effect of denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 1-2 doses to no treatment in the pre-surgical setting on Ki67 proliferation index by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube of premenopausal BRCA1/2 mutation carriers undergoing risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, with or without hysterectomy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess Ki67 proliferation index by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in ovarian surface epithelium and endometrium (if also undergoing a hysterectomy, \\~20% of participants) after exposure to denosumab compared to no treatment.\n\nII. To investigate other tissue-based biomarkers in the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube, ovarian surface epithelium, and endometrium (if also undergoing hysterectomy) after exposure to denosumab compared to no treatment, including:\n\nIIa. Apoptosis with cleaved caspase-3 by IHC. IIb. Receptor activator of NF-KB (RANK) and RANK ligand (RANKL) expression by IHC.\n\nIIc. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression by IHC. IId. CD44 and p53 expression by IHC. IIe. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and phosphorylated-STAT3 (pSTAT3) expression by IHC.\n\nIII. To analyze gene expression profiling in the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube and ovarian surface epithelium after exposure to denosumab compared to no treatment.\n\nIV. To investigate serum biomarkers at baseline (pre-treatment) and time of surgery (post-treatment) with denosumab compared to no treatment, including:\n\nIVa. Progesterone. IVb. Estradiol. IVc. Denosumab drug levels. V. To investigate serial serum C-terminal telopeptide (CTX) levels from baseline (pre-treatment) to time of surgery to 9 months and 12 months after start of intervention with denosumab compared to no treatment.\n\nVI.

A woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use highly effective contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 3 months after completion of duvelisib administration. WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 24 hours of leukapheresis, lymphodepletion (if performed) and tisagenlecleucel infusion (if lymphodepletion not performed)\n* The patient must be willing to comply with fertility requirements as below:\n* Total abstinence (when this is in line with the usual practice and lifestyle of the patient). Periodic abstinence (i.e, calendar, ovulation, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawals are not acceptable forms of contraception\n* Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without a hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone assessment\n* Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner\n* Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception, or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) or other forms of contraception that comparable efficacy (failure rate \\< 1%). In case of oral contraception, the woman should be stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months prior to enrollment on the study\n* Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse from enrollment into this study until at least 12 months after tisagenlecleucel infusion and until CAR-T cells are no longer present by qPCR on two consecutive tests (qPCR tests will be available upon request). A condom is required of all sexually active male patients to prevent them from fathering a child AND to prevent delivery of study treatment via seminal fluid to their partner\n* Female patients must be either postmenopausal, free from menses \\>= 2 years (yrs), surgically sterilized, willing to use two adequate barrier methods of contraception to prevent pregnancy or agree to abstain from heterosexual activity starting with screening and for 5 months after last treatment in all patients\n* Patients must agree not to donate blood, sperm/ova or any other organs while taking protocol therapy and for at least 12 months after stopping treatment\n* Willingness and ability of the patient to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan, protocol specified laboratory tests, other study procedures and study restrictions\n* Evidence of personally signed informed consent indicating that the subject is aware of the neoplastic nature of the disease and has been informed on the procedures to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternative, potential risks and discomforts, potential benefits and other pertinent aspects of study participation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Primary central nervous system lymphoma\n* Patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement of lymphoma\n* History of autoimmune disease, including but not limited to:\n\n  * Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease)\n  * Systemic lupus erythematosus\n  * Grave's disease\n  * Myasthenia gravis\n  * Rheumatoid arthritis\n  * Wegner's syndrome\n* Patients with history of drug reaction and eosinophilia systemic syndrome (DRESS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)\n* History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active Hepatitis C Infection or active Hepatitis B infection as defined by:\n\n  * Patients with a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab) will be excluded\n  * Patients with a positive hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) must have negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to be eligible and must be periodically monitored for HBV reactivation by institutional guidelines\n* Patients with known active cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (i.e., subjects with detectable viral load)\n* Patients with ongoing treatment for systemic bacterial, fungal or viral infection\n* Patients with history of immune or drug mediated colitis, hepatitis or pneumonitis\n* Patients with previous treatment with a PI3K inhibitor\n* Patients currently on immunosuppressive therapy, including steroids\n* Previous CD 19 directed therapy\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> grade 1)\n* Patients receiving any other investigational drugs\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because duvelisib is agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
