### Problem statement (Problem Domain and Impact Potential)
At the core of AI and data science, we believe that impact is driven in solving repetetive tasks that require specialized skills, essentially tackling the "unsexy" problem where it is the bottleneck of the workflow that requires grunt work and distracts people from tackling the real issue. In clinical trials, that part is the regulatory cross-examination, often a point that hinders the progress of research and innovation...
